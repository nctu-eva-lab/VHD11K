    "# Making OpenAI Assistants Teachable\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversational assistants based on LLMs can remember the current chat with the user, and can even demonstrate in-context learning of things that the user teaches the assistant during the chat. But these memories and learnings are lost once the chat is over, or when a single chat grows too long for the LLM to handle effectively. In subsequent chats, the user is forced to repeat any necessary instructions over and over.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional agent capability called `Teachability` addresses these limitations by persisting user teachings across chat boundaries in long-term memory (a vector database). Memories (called memos) are created and saved to disk throughout a conversation, then loaded from disk later. Instead of copying all the memos into the context window, which would eat up valuable space, individual memos are retrieved into context only as needed. This allows the user to teach many facts, preferences and skills to the teachable agent just once, and have it remember them in later chats.\n",
    "\n",
    "In making decisions about memo storage and retrieval, `Teachability` calls an instance of `TextAnalyzerAgent` to analyze pieces of text in several different ways. This adds extra LLM calls involving a relatively small number of tokens. These calls can add a few seconds to the time a user waits for a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how `Teachability` can be added to instances of `GPTAssistantAgent`\n",
    "so that they can learn facts, preferences, and skills from users. As explained [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/11/13/OAI-assistants), each instance of `GPTAssistantAgent` wraps an OpenAI Assistant that can be given a set of tools including functions, code interpreter, and retrieval. Assistants with these tools are demonstrated in separate standalone sections below, which can be run independently.\n",
