    "# Using RetrieveChat with Qdrant for Retrieve Augmented Code Generation and Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "[Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) is a high-performance vector search engine/database.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the usage of `QdrantRetrieveUserProxyAgent` for RAG, based on [agentchat_RetrieveChat.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_RetrieveChat.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "RetrieveChat is a conversational system for retrieve augmented code generation and question answering. In this notebook, we demonstrate how to utilize RetrieveChat to generate code and answer questions based on customized documentations that are not present in the LLM's training dataset. RetrieveChat uses the `RetrieveAssistantAgent` and `QdrantRetrieveUserProxyAgent`, which is similar to the usage of `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` in other notebooks (e.g., [Automated Task Solving with Code Generation, Execution & Debugging](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_auto_feedback_from_code_execution.ipynb)).\n",

      "## What is FLAML\n",
      "FLAML is a lightweight Python library for efficient automation of machine\n",
      "learning and AI operations. It automates workflow based on large language models, machine learning models, etc.\n",
      "and optimizes their performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "* FLAML enables building next-gen GPT-X applications based on multi-agent conversations with minimal effort. It simplifies the orchestration, automation and optimization of a complex GPT-X workflow. It maximizes the performance of GPT-X models and augments their weakness.\n",
      "* For common machine learning tasks like classification and regression, it quickly finds quality models for user-provided data with low computational resources. It is easy to customize or extend. Users can find their desired customizability from a smooth range.\n",
      "* It supports fast and economical automatic tuning (e.g., inference hyperparameters for foundation models, configurations in MLOps/LMOps workflows, pipelines, mathematical/statistical models, algorithms, computing experiments, software configurations), capable of handling large search space with heterogeneous evaluation cost and complex constraints/guidance/early stopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "FLAML is powered by a series of [research studies](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Research/) from Microsoft Research and collaborators such as Penn State University, Stevens Institute of Technology, University of Washington, and University of Waterloo.\n",
      "\n",
      "FLAML has a .NET implementation in [ML.NET](http://dot.net/ml), an open-source, cross-platform machine learning framework for .NET.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Installation\n",
      "\n",
      "FLAML requires **Python version >= 3.8**. It can be installed from pip:\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "pip install flaml\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Minimal dependencies are installed without extra options. You can install extra options based on the feature you need. For example, use the following to install the dependencies needed by the [`autogen`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) package.\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "pip install \"flaml[autogen]\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Find more options in [Installation](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Installation).\n",
      "Each of the [`notebook examples`](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/tree/main/notebook) may require a specific option to be installed.\n",

      "## Quickstart\n",
      "\n",
      "* (New) The [autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) package enables the next-gen GPT-X applications with a generic multi-agent conversation framework.\n",
      "It offers customizable and conversable agents which integrate LLMs, tools and human.\n",
      "By automating chat among multiple capable agents, one can easily make them collectively perform tasks autonomously or with human feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code. For example,\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from flaml import autogen\n",
      "assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(\"assistant\")\n",
      "user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(\"user_proxy\")\n",
      "user_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message=\"Show me the YTD gain of 10 largest technology companies as of today.\")\n",
      "# This initiates an automated chat between the two agents to solve the task\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Autogen also helps maximize the utility out of the expensive LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. It offers a drop-in replacement of `openai.Completion` or `openai.ChatCompletion` with powerful functionalites like tuning, caching, templating, filtering. For example, you can optimize generations by LLM with your own tuning data, success metrics and budgets.\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# perform tuning\n",
      "config, analysis = autogen.Completion.tune(\n",

      "## What is FLAML\n",
      "FLAML is a lightweight Python library for efficient automation of machine\n",
      "learning and AI operations. It automates workflow based on large language models, machine learning models, etc.\n",
      "and optimizes their performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "* FLAML enables building next-gen GPT-X applications based on multi-agent conversations with minimal effort. It simplifies the orchestration, automation and optimization of a complex GPT-X workflow. It maximizes the performance of GPT-X models and augments their weakness.\n",
      "* For common machine learning tasks like classification and regression, it quickly finds quality models for user-provided data with low computational resources. It is easy to customize or extend. Users can find their desired customizability from a smooth range.\n",
      "* It supports fast and economical automatic tuning (e.g., inference hyperparameters for foundation models, configurations in MLOps/LMOps workflows, pipelines, mathematical/statistical models, algorithms, computing experiments, software configurations), capable of handling large search space with heterogeneous evaluation cost and complex constraints/guidance/early stopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "FLAML is powered by a series of [research studies](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Research/) from Microsoft Research and collaborators such as Penn State University, Stevens Institute of Technology, University of Washington, and University of Waterloo.\n",
      "\n",
      "FLAML has a .NET implementation in [ML.NET](http://dot.net/ml), an open-source, cross-platform machine learning framework for .NET.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Installation\n",
      "\n",
      "FLAML requires **Python version >= 3.8**. It can be installed from pip:\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "pip install flaml\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Minimal dependencies are installed without extra options. You can install extra options based on the feature you need. For example, use the following to install the dependencies needed by the [`autogen`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) package.\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "pip install \"flaml[autogen]\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Find more options in [Installation](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Installation).\n",
      "Each of the [`notebook examples`](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/tree/main/notebook) may require a specific option to be installed.\n",

      "## Quickstart\n",
      "\n",
      "* (New) The [autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) package enables the next-gen GPT-X applications with a generic multi-agent conversation framework.\n",
      "It offers customizable and conversable agents which integrate LLMs, tools and human.\n",
      "By automating chat among multiple capable agents, one can easily make them collectively perform tasks autonomously or with human feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code. For example,\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from flaml import autogen\n",
      "assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(\"assistant\")\n",
      "user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(\"user_proxy\")\n",
      "user_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message=\"Show me the YTD gain of 10 largest technology companies as of today.\")\n",
      "# This initiates an automated chat between the two agents to solve the task\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Autogen also helps maximize the utility out of the expensive LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. It offers a drop-in replacement of `openai.Completion` or `openai.ChatCompletion` with powerful functionalites like tuning, caching, templating, filtering. For example, you can optimize generations by LLM with your own tuning data, success metrics and budgets.\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# perform tuning\n",
      "config, analysis = autogen.Completion.tune(\n",

Alongside this move, we have also launched a dedicated [Discord](https://discord.gg/pAbnFJrkgZ) server and a [website](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) for comprehensive documentation.\\n\\n:fire: The automated multi-agent chat framework in [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) is in preview from v2.0.0.\\n\\n:fire: FLAML is highlighted in OpenAI\\'s [cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook#related-resources-from-around-the-web).\\n\\n:fire: [autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) is released with support for ChatGPT and GPT-4, based on [Cost-Effective Hyperparameter Optimization for Large Language Model Generation Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04673).\\n\\n:fire: FLAML supports Code-First AutoML & Tuning – Private Preview in [Microsoft Fabric Data Science](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/).\\n\\n\\n## What is FLAML\\nFLAML is a lightweight Python library for efficient automation of machine\\nlearning and AI operations. It automates workflow based on large language models, machine learning models, etc.\\nand optimizes their performance.\\n\\n* FLAML enables building next-gen GPT-X applications based on multi-agent conversations with minimal effort. It simplifies the orchestration, automation and optimization of a complex GPT-X workflow. It maximizes the performance of GPT-X models and augments their weakness.\\n* For common machine learning tasks like classification and regression, it quickly finds quality models for user-provided data with low computational resources. It is easy to customize or extend. Users can find their desired customizability from a smooth range.\\n* It supports fast and economical automatic tuning (e.g., inference hyperparameters for foundation models, configurations in MLOps/LMOps workflows, pipelines, mathematical/statistical models, algorithms, computing experiments, software configurations), capable of handling large search space with heterogeneous evaluation cost and complex constraints/guidance/early stopping.\\n\\nFLAML is powered by a series of [research studies](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Research/) from Microsoft Research and collaborators such as Penn State University, Stevens Institute of Technology, University of Washington, and University of Waterloo.\\n\\nFLAML has a .NET implementation in [ML.NET](http://dot.net/ml), an open-source, cross-platform machine learning framework for .NET.\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nFLAML requires **Python version >= 3.8**. It can be installed from pip:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install flaml\\n```\\n\\nMinimal dependencies are installed without extra options. You can install extra options based on the feature you need. For example, use the following to install the dependencies needed by the [`autogen`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) package.\\n```bash\\npip install \"flaml[autogen]\"\\n```\\n\\nFind more options in [Installation](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Installation).\\nEach of the [`notebook examples`](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/tree/main/notebook) may require a specific option to be installed.\\n\\n## Quickstart\\n\\n* (New) The [autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) package enables the next-gen GPT-X applications with a generic multi-agent conversation framework.\\nIt offers customizable and conversable agents which integrate LLMs, tools and human.\\nBy automating chat among multiple capable agents, one can easily make them collectively perform tasks autonomously or with human feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code. For example,\\n```python\\nfrom flaml import autogen\\nassistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(\"assistant\")\\nuser_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(\"user_proxy\")\\nuser_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message=\"Show me the YTD gain of 10 largest technology companies as of today.\")\\n# This initiates an automated chat between the two agents to solve the task\\n```\\n\\nAutogen also helps maximize the utility out of the expensive LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. It offers a drop-in replacement of `openai.Completion` or `openai.ChatCompletion` with powerful functionalites like tuning, caching, templating, filtering. For example, you can optimize generations by LLM with your own tuning data, success metrics and budgets.\\n```python\\n# perform tuning\\nconfig, analysis = autogen.Completion.tune(\\n    data=tune_data,\\n    metric=\"success\",\\n    mode=\"max\",\\n    eval_func=eval_func,\\n    inference_budget=0.05,\\n    optimization_budget=3,\\n    num_samples=-1,\\n)\\n# perform inference for a test instance\\nresponse = autogen.Completion.create(context=test_instance, **config)\\n```\\n* With three lines of code, you can start using this economical and fast\\nAutoML engine as a [scikit-learn style estimator](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML).\\n\\n```python\\nfrom flaml import AutoML\\nautoml = AutoML()\\nautoml.fit(X_train, y_train, task=\"classification\")\\n```\\n\\n* You can restrict the learners and use FLAML as a fast hyperparameter tuning\\ntool for XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest etc. or a [customized learner](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#estimator-and-search-space).\\n\\n```python\\nautoml.fit(X_train, y_train, task=\"classification\", estimator_list=[\"lgbm\"])\\n```\\n\\n* You can also run generic hyperparameter tuning for a [custom function](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function).\\n\\n```python\\nfrom flaml import tune\\ntune.run(evaluation_function, config={…}, low_cost_partial_config={…}, time_budget_s=3600)\\n```\\n\\n* [Zero-shot AutoML](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Zero-Shot-AutoML) allows using the existing training API from lightgbm, xgboost etc. while getting the benefit of AutoML in choosing high-performance hyperparameter configurations per task.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom flaml.default import LGBMRegressor\\n\\n# Use LGBMRegressor in the same way as you use lightgbm.LGBMRegressor.\\nestimator = LGBMRegressor()\\n# The hyperparameters are automatically set according to the training data.\\nestimator.fit(X_train, y_train)\\n```\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nYou can find a detailed documentation about FLAML [here](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/).\\n\\nIn addition, you can find:\\n\\n- [Research](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Research) and [blogposts](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/blog) around FLAML.\\n\\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/Cppx2vSPVP).\\n\\n- [Contributing guide](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Contribute).\\n\\n- ML.NET documentation and tutorials for [Model Builder](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/predict-prices-with-model-builder), [ML.NET CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/sentiment-analysis-cli), and [AutoML API](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/machine-learning/how-to-guides/how-to-use-the-automl-api).\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.
