# Installation

## Create a virtual environment (optional)

When installing AutoGen locally, we recommend using a virtual environment for the installation. This will ensure that the dependencies for AutoGen are isolated from the rest of your system.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="venv" label="venv" default>

    Create and activate:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv pyautogen
    source pyautogen/bin/activate
    ```

    To deactivate later, run:

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="conda" label="Conda">

    [Install Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html) if you have not already.


    Create and activate:

    ```bash
    conda create -n pyautogen python=3.10
    conda activate pyautogen
    ```

    To deactivate later, run:

    ```bash
    conda deactivate
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="poetry" label="Poetry">

    [Install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) if you have not already.

    Create and activate:
    ```bash
    poetry init
    poetry shell

    poetry add pyautogen
    ```

    To deactivate later, run:

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Install AutoGen

AutoGen requires **Python version >= 3.8, < 3.13**. It can be installed from pip:

```bash
pip install pyautogen
```

:::info

`pyautogen<0.2` required `openai<1`. Starting from pyautogen v0.2, `openai>=1` is required.

## Code execution with Docker (default)

Even if you install AutoGen locally, we highly recommend using Docker for [code execution](FAQ.mdx#code-execution).

The default behaviour for code-execution agents is for code execution to be performed in a docker container.

**To turn this off**: if you want to run the code locally (not recommended) then `use_docker` can be set to `False` in `code_execution_config` for each code-execution agent, or set `AUTOGEN_USE_DOCKER` to `False` as an environment variable.

You might want to override the default docker image used for code execution. To do that set `use_docker` key of `code_execution_config` property to the name of the image. E.g.:

```python
user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    name="agent",
    human_input_mode="TERMINATE",
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=10,
    code_execution_config={"work_dir":"_output", "use_docker":"python:3"},
    llm_config=llm_config,
    system_message=""""Reply TERMINATE if the task has been solved at full satisfaction.
Otherwise, reply CONTINUE, or the reason why the task is not solved yet."""
)
```

**Turn off code execution entirely**: if you want to turn off code execution entirely, set `code_execution_config` to `False`. E.g.:

```python
user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    name="agent",
    llm_config=llm_config,
    code_execution_config=False,
)
```
