# Getting Started

AutoGen is a framework that enables development of LLM applications using
multiple agents that can converse with each other to solve tasks. AutoGen agents
are customizable, conversable, and seamlessly allow human participation. They
can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and
tools.

### Main Features

- AutoGen enables building next-gen LLM applications based on [multi-agent
  conversations](/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat) with minimal effort. It simplifies
  the orchestration, automation, and optimization of a complex LLM workflow. It
  maximizes the performance of LLM models and overcomes their weaknesses.
- It supports [diverse conversation
  patterns](/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat#supporting-diverse-conversation-patterns)
  for complex workflows. With customizable and conversable agents, developers can
  use AutoGen to build a wide range of conversation patterns concerning
  conversation autonomy, the number of agents, and agent conversation topology.
- It provides a collection of working systems with different complexities. These
  systems span a [wide range of
  applications](/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat#diverse-applications-implemented-with-autogen)
  from various domains and complexities. This demonstrates how AutoGen can
  easily support diverse conversation patterns.

AutoGen is powered by collaborative [research studies](/docs/Research) from
Microsoft, Penn State University, and University of Washington.

### Quickstart

```sh
pip install pyautogen
```

```python
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent
from autogen.coding import LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor

import os
from pathlib import Path

llm_config = {
    "config_list": [{"model": "gpt-4", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}],
}

work_dir = Path("coding")
work_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

assistant = AssistantAgent("assistant", llm_config=llm_config)

code_executor = LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor(work_dir=work_dir)
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    "user_proxy", code_execution_config={"executor": code_executor}

# Start the chat
user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    assistant,
    message="Plot a chart of NVDA and TESLA stock price change YTD.",
)
```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker execution" default>

```python
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent
from autogen.coding import DockerCommandLineCodeExecutor

import os
from pathlib import Path

llm_config = {
    "config_list": [{"model": "gpt-4", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}],
}

work_dir = Path("coding")
work_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

with DockerCommandLineCodeExecutor(work_dir=work_dir) as code_executor:
    assistant = AssistantAgent("assistant", llm_config=llm_config)
    user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
        "user_proxy", code_execution_config={"executor": code_executor}
    )

    # Start the chat
    user_proxy.initiate_chat(
        assistant,
        message="Plot a chart of NVDA and TESLA stock price change YTD. Save the plot to a file called plot.png",
    )
```

Open `coding/plot.png` to see the generated plot.

  </TabItem>

#### Multi-Agent Conversation Framework

Autogen enables the next-gen LLM applications with a generic multi-agent conversation framework. It offers customizable and conversable agents which integrate LLMs, tools, and humans.
By automating chat among multiple capable agents, one can easily make them collectively perform tasks autonomously or with human feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code. For [example](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/test/twoagent.py),

The figure below shows an example conversation flow with AutoGen.
