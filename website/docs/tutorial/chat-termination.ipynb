    "# Terminating Conversations Between Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will explore how to terminate a conversation between AutoGen agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "_But why is this important?_ Its because in any complex, autonomous workflows it's crucial to know when to stop the workflow. For example, when the task is completed, or perhaps when the process has consumed enough resources and needs to either stop or adopt different strategies, such as user intervention. So AutoGen natively supports several mechanisms to terminate conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to Control Termination with AutoGen?\n",
    "Currently there are two broad mechanism to control the termination of conversations between agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specify parameters in `initiate_chat`**: When initiating a chat, you can define parameters that determine when the conversation should end.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Configure an agent to trigger termination**: When defining individual agents, you can specify parameters that allow agents to terminate of a conversation based on particular (configurable) conditions."

To accomplish this the agent maintains a counter of the number of consecutive automatic responses to the same sender. Note that this counter can be reset because of human intervention. We will describe this in more detail in the next chapter.\n",
