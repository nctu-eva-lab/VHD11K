    "A two-agent chats takes two inputs: a message, which is a string provided by\n",
    "the caller; a context, which specifies various parameters of the chat.\n",
    "The sender agent uses its chat initializer method\n",
    "(i.e., `generate_init_message` method of `ConversableAgent`)\n",
    "to generate an initial message from the inputs, and\n",
    "sends it to the recipient agent to start the chat.\n",
    "The sender agent is the agent whose `initiate_chat` method is called, and\n",
    "the recipient agent is the other agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the chat terminates, the history of the chat is processed by a \n",
    "chat summarizer. The summarizer summarizes the chat history and calculates\n",
    "the token usage of the chat. \n",
    "You can configure the type of summary using the `summary_method`\n",
