    "\n",
    "While there are many definitions of agents, in AutoGen, an agent is an entity that can send messages, receive messages and generate a reply using models, tools, human inputs or a mixture of them.\n",
    "This abstraction not only allows agents to model real-world and abstract entities, such as people and algorithms, but it also simplifies implementation of complex workflows as collaboration among agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, AutoGen is extensible and composable: you can extend a simple agent with customizable components and create workflows that can combine these agents and power a more sophisticated agent, resulting in implementations that are modular and easy to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, AutoGen is developed by a vibrant community of researchers\n",
    "and engineers. It incorporates the latest research in multi-agent systems\n",
    "and has been used in many real-world applications, including agent platform,\n",
    "advertising, AI employees, blog/article writing, blockchain, calculate burned areas by wildfires,\n",
    "customer support, cybersecurity, data analytics, debate, education, finance, gaming, legal consultation,\n",

    "\n",
    "You can switch each component on or off and customize it to suit the need of \n",
